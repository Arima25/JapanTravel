      Kimono
    </h2>
    <p>
      Kimono is the traditional dress of Japan and are generally made of silk, and it have large sleeves that reach from the shoulders all the way down to the heels. 
      They are tied with a wide belt called an obi. Kimonos are usually worn only on special occasions, such as the Shichi-Go-San festival, weddings, and graduation ceremonies.
      Kimono is different than the western dress as the kimono tends to limit one's movement, and it takes more time to put on properly compare to a western dress.
      <br> There is a second kind of Kimono call yukata and it is generally worn by children and young adults at festivals, fireworks displays, and other special occasions. 
      The difference between the 2 kimono is that yukata are more easily worn and it is use mainly in the summer.
