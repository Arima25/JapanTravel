      2. Kyoto
    </h2>
    <p align="center">
      If you don't want to go to Tokyo the modern part of Japan. Check out Kyoto the traditonal part of Japan. When you first arrived in Kyoto, you will often find it disappointing, you should head out towards the mountains to the surrounding neighbourhoods where you’ll find narrow stone streets, old wooden houses, monks in flowing robes, and the sounds of chanting and gongs from the many temples and shrines.
      In kyoto, you can also find wooden teahouses, forests of bamboo, temples and shrines in gold and silver and scarlet, raked gravel Zen gardens, intricate feasts served on lacquered plates, graceful tea ceremonies, and markets full of intriguing but unidentifiable ingredients, and more.

      Mount Fuji is on most people’s lists of places to visit in Japan, but this must-see Japan landmark can be rather elusive and is often hidden by clouds.
      There are many place you can see this landmark, a rather easy place that let you see this landmark if you ever go to Tokyo would be Hakone as it less than one hundred kilometers away from Tokyo. 
      Even when it a rainy, cloud day you can still see Mount Fuji from Hankone.
